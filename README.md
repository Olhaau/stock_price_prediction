# Predicting stock prices

## Project overview
* In this project I wanted to forecast stock prices using the time series prediction methods (ARIMA, LSTM) from my [weather forecast project](https://github.com/Olhaau/weather_forecast_trier) 
* used Microsoft closing stock prices

* TODO:
* AutoARIMA
* Comparison of ARIMA and LSTM
* the goal is a tool that gathers most recent stock market data and make accurate forecasts

## Calculated results of a LSTM forecast
